We are a keen group of students from IIITB who decides to work on a discord bot with which we can do fun activities like hunting,fishing and mining and with the money we make selling these items in the market, 
we can use it to play fun mini games which can help you win more by betting on it. There are fun games such as blackjack,tictactoe,guessing games. We have made an option to check our stats and also checking the 
stats of the leader and keeping the stats of the rest of the users anonymous.

#Steps to get the bot to work...#
We have made a private bot which works only on our server. The workings of the bot could be understood by our video demonstration. You can visit our discord server to get it and notify us to show our bot working 
in real time. Another option would be to make your own bot with the MAIN.PY code change the guildid to the guildid of the server you want to test it on and getting a bot token and changing the empty client.run('')
with your bot token. Since our code was made purely as an inter-server bot, we have not implemented it as a worldwide bot yet due to our time limitations.

#Features we were planning on implementing but could not due to our time constraints but we definitely could try in the future#
1) A proper worldwide bot with which we can trade with multiple users and make a proper economy system
2) A database which stores information of every player. We are still keen on implementing more as we believe we have done a great job implementing a bot by learning it from scratch
3) Make auctions for a product and not just fixed market prices(something that would bring a real fun twist and make the economy system better rather than trading with fixed prices)
4) Command Cooldowns were also an option such that quick instructions could maybe slow our bot down and make it look less efficient
5) Daily Login Rewards and paid gifts :)
